# Focus Jam Policies and Guide
Focus Jam is a philosophy designed to foster collaboration and sharing in a work environment. It mirrors our clients' dynamic schedules filled with meetings and discussions. In the Focus Jam, we encourage open dialogue about your day, your projects, and even your feelings towards them. This openness promotes a sense of community and shared understanding among team members.

Focus Jams are designed to make remote work more engaging and productive. They provide a platform for everyone to share their ideas, participate in ice breakers, and take notes. In a Focus Jam, you can lead the jam with the camera turned on, participate with great audio, or listen with transcriptions turned on. This setup allows for active collaboration and brainstorming, while also providing an opportunity for passive learning. It also helps to break down barriers between different levels of management, fostering a more inclusive work environment.

### :pencil2: Knowledge Transfer
Focus Jams facilitate seamless knowledge transfer, a crucial aspect of any successful organization. By providing a platform for open dialogue and collaboration, Focus Jams allow for the fluid exchange of ideas and information, ensuring that all team members are up-to-date and informed.

### :pencil2: Communication in the Workforce
Effective communication is crucial in the workforce, especially in a remote work setting. Through Focus Jams, we aim to promote clear and efficient communication among team members. We will bring in statistics on verbal communication and its importance in our Focus Jam philosophy to further emphasize this point.

### :cyclone: Video and Audio Communication
Video and audio communication are essential tools in our digital age. We recommend that at least 25% of all meetings should be conducted via video. This not only enhances the communication experience but also allows for better engagement among team members. Quality audio equipment is also encouraged to ensure clear and efficient communication. Remember, communication is not just about words; non-verbal cues, which make up 90% of communication, can only be picked up through video communication.

### :cyclone: Adherence to Philosophy
To ensure that our philosophy is being followed, we will use statistics and analysis of MS Teams meetings. This will allow us to monitor the effectiveness of our approach and make necessary adjustments to better serve our clients.

### :cyclone: In the Absence of Your Focus Cell
In the event that no one from your Focus Cell is online, we encourage joining a generic group or cell. This not only allows for continued collaboration but also promotes cross-departmental knowledge transfer and interaction.

In conclusion, Focus Jams are an innovative and effective way to promote collaboration, knowledge transfer, and effective communication in a remote work setting.
